export const mirrorCardsArtPrompt = `A solitary human figure standing before a tall, ornate mirror.
The figure is seen from behind, softly lit, with minimal detail — more presence than identity.
Clothing is simple and timeless, without modern fashion.
The mirror surface glows faintly, revealing the reflection of a serene archetypal goddess.
The goddess is calm, symmetrical, and luminous.
The scene feels symbolic, quiet, and dreamlike.
Painterly, ethereal illustration.
No visible face.
No transformation effects.
No modern environment.`;
