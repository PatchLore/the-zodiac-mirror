# Zodiac Mirror — Product Vision & Phased Roadmap

## Core Philosophy

Zodiac Mirror is not a horoscope, a game, or a prediction engine.

It is a reflective surface — an experience designed to show the user something they already carry, not tell them what will happen.

### Guiding principles:

- **Presence over prediction**
- **Recognition over transformation**
- **Stillness over stimulation**
- **Depth over novelty**

The product should feel quiet, intentional, and memorable, not addictive or noisy.

## MVP1 — CURRENT STATE (LIVE / SHIPPING)

### What Zodiac Mirror Is Today

A calm, mobile-first web app

- 12 archetypal goddesses
- One reflective result per user
- No randomisation loops
- No gamification
- No urgency

The result screen is the experience.

Users can:
- Receive their goddess reflection
- Sit with it
- Optionally personalise it

This is deliberate.

## Personalised Portrait — Primary Monetisation (MVP1)

### Single Bundled Product (No Options)

**Product**

**Personalised Portrait — Zodiac Mirror**  
£35.00 GBP

**Includes**

- A personalised portrait image
- A short living portrait (5–7s looping MP4, subtle aura motion)
- A curated soundtrack of 10 tracks inspired by the reflection

- No radios
- No add-ons
- No tiers

One product, one price, one CTA.

### Positioning

- Hand-crafted
- Interpretive
- Not an instant filter
- Delivered privately by email

**The artist interprets.**  
**The user reflects.**

### Portrait Request Flow (Email-Based)

Portraits are requested via email after payment.

**Attunement Questions (Email Body)**

Users are guided with gentle, optional questions:

- Reflection / goddess (if known)
- Quality lean (Calm / Power / Mystery / Balance / Not sure)
- Mirror-based prompt: *"When you imagine this portrait as a mirror, what should it reflect back to you?"*
- Anything to avoid
- Additional requests (optional)

The user provides signals, not specifications.  
Creative authority remains with the artist.

### Living Portraits (MP4)

- Included by default (not optional)
- 5–7 seconds
- Seamless loop
- No camera movement
- No dramatic animation
- No audio by default

Motion should feel: **quietly alive, not performative**

MP4s are delivered privately by email, not embedded aggressively in the app.

### Soundtrack Inclusion

Each personalised portrait includes:

- A curated soundtrack of 10 tracks
- Ambient / cinematic / ritual tone
- No algorithmic claims
- No "mood analysis" language

**Positioning:** Curated intuitively as an extension of the same reflection.

Sound is an artifact, not a feature.

## Zodiac Mirror Cards — Phase 1 (Foundation)

### Cards Page (Live)

- `/cards` route exists
- Introduces Zodiac Mirror Cards as quiet artifacts
- No pricing
- No checkout
- No email capture

Cards are framed as: **objects you return to, not content you consume**

### Digital Cards First (Correct Strategy)

- Digital Edition only initially
- No print-on-demand until demand is proven
- High-resolution fronts and backs
- Framed as a "Digital Edition", not "PDFs"

**Digital cards are not a compromise — they are the first edition.**

---

## Mirror Cards — Phase 2 Concept

Mirror Cards are a second edition, not a replacement.

### Structure

- **Front:** Goddess only (iconic, resolved)
- **Back:** Human figure seen from behind, facing a mirror
- The goddess appears only as the reflection

### Key rules:

- No visible face
- No modern fashion
- No strong identity markers
- Symbolic, timeless, liminal

**Mirror Cards are about recognition, not transformation.**

---

## Daily / Weekly Mirror — FUTURE (MVP2, NOT BUILT YET)

### Purpose:

- Gentle return gravity
- Not addiction
- Not daily obligation

### Format

- Primarily text-only
- 1–2 lines
- Non-directive
- Non-predictive
- No instructions

Images are:
- Occasional
- Intentional
- Never daily by default

**The Mirror is a surface, not content.**

---

## Roblox-Style Monetisation (Translated, Not Copied)

Roblox mechanics are not copied directly.

Underlying principles adapted:
- Soft currency → Mirror Credits (future)
- Cosmetics → Aura variations
- Identity → Private collections
- Repeat spend → Micro deepening, not necessity

### Hard rules:

- No streaks
- No timers
- No FOMO
- No "unlock" language

All monetisation must feel like: **an invitation to go deeper**

These are MVP2+, only after traffic and demand are proven.
