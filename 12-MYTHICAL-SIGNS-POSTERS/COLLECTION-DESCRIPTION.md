## Full Collection Description

### 12 Mythical Signs Posters

A curated collection of twelve digital art posters, each representing a zodiac sign through an archetypal goddess figure. Drawn from the same symbolic language as The Zodiac Mirror, these posters are quiet, reflective artifacts—presence over prediction, recognition over interpretation.

Each piece is designed to stand alone or as part of the complete set, suitable for digital display or high-quality printing. The aesthetic is painterly, ethereal, and timeless—rooted in archetypal imagery without modern fashion or environments.

**The Collection Includes:**
- 12 high-resolution PNG files

- Print-ready quality (specifications in PRODUCT-INFO.md)

**Design Philosophy:**

**Perfect For:**
- Digital art collectors
- Zodiac enthusiasts seeking quality artwork
- Interior design (digital displays or printed)
- Gifts for astrology-interested individuals
- Completing a zodiac-themed space
